# cumulative.do

## Introduction and Goals:

This product will be a to do list web application that aims to collect assignment data from Canvas and course websites to automatically create and update a personalized list of to-dos for the user. The application will also allow users to be able to add in other to do list items. To-do list items will be displayed in chronological order of due date and will be crossed off from the list as the user checks off the tasks. The target audience of this product would be students at UW, particularly students in the CSE department, but can eventually be expanded to students in general. 

## Repository Layout:

- All backend code contained in src/main/java.
- All configuration/set up content contained in .idea folder.
