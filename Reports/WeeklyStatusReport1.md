# Team Report:

### Goals From Last Week:

Empty because this is our first week of submitting weekly reports.

### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

As a team, we spend the past week finally beginning our project. We divided our team of four people into two groups - Drishya and Hai began working on front-end related tasks while Yuzhen and Carrie began working on back-end related tasks. Specifically, the front-end team finalized the UX/UI designs and created a workflow of how the application should work. They also began doing the actual front-end coding with HTML and CSS. The focus for this week for the front-end team was the visual appearance of the application. The back-end team began setting up the back-end architecture and structure of the project. The backend team also brainstormed the logic for how some of the initial functionalities of the application would work and finished the past week off by getting started on working with databases and SQL. From the work accomplished, what worked well was the UX/UI design work because this enabled us to have a sense of direction of where we wanted to go with this project. Additionally, we feel that our project's backend structure is set up well and that we are now able to begin the actual back-end coding process. Throughout the week we ended up learning a lot about packages, ER diagrams, SQL, databases, and more, simply from the work we accomplished. As this is just the initial stages of the project, we don’t feel like we are stuck anywhere. We had a little trouble deciding on the workflow of the application but we ended up figuring that out.

### Plans & Goals For Upcoming Week:

* Finish coding the front-end appearance of the application through HTML and CSS.
Task Assigned To: Drishya & Hai
Time Estimate: 1 Day
Finish coding the basic to-do list functionality through JavaScript.
Task Assigned To: Drishya & Hai
Time Estimate: 2 Days
Finish researching about canvas API technology.
Task Assigned To: Yuzhen & Carrie
Time Estimate: 2 Days
Finish researching about web scraping.
Task Assigned To: Yuzhen & Carrie
Time Estimate: 2 Days
Implement basic login functionality.
Task Assigned To: Yuzhen & Carrie
Time Estimate: 3 Days

In the upcoming project meeting, we will meet with our project manager, discuss what other backend tasks need to be done, and finalize the timeline for Drishya and Hai’s transition to helping on the back-end after they are completed with the front-end.

# Individual Contributions:

### Goals From Last Week:

Drishya: Empty because this is our first week of submitting weekly reports.

Hai: Empty because this is our first week of submitting weekly reports.

Yuzhen: Empty because this is our first week of submitting weekly reports.

Carrie: Empty because this is our first week of submitting weekly reports.

### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

Drishya: Drishya completed some sections of the documentation and also accomplished some basic front-end coding for the application. She has begun working on the HTML and CSS of the site. In the past week, Drishya has learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now has a good idea of how to use JavaScript to implement the basic to-do list functionality. All of that worked very well. Drishya had some trouble understanding the backend content that the rest of the team was working on first but after talking with her team members, she understands this a lot more. Drishya is a little stuck on understanding if the login features need to be done by the front-end team or the backend team.

Hai: Hai completed the UX/UI designs and workflow for the application in the past week and has moved on to helping Drishya with front-end coding. The UX/Ui designs are something that really worked well as we now have a general idea of what direction we are headed in. One thing Hai has been learning about in the past week is more about the front-end technologies since this is his first time working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hai had a little trouble with the workflow at first and was stuck, but after discussing it as a whole team, we were able to reach an agreement on what we though was best for the workflow.

Yuzhen: Yuzhen, along with Carrie, set up Maven and the link packages, decided on attributes for models, figured out the relationships between models through the use of ER diagrams, brainstormed login logic and added tentative methods, and finally began working with SQL and databases which allowed the models to become entities and generate unique ids for each object created. All of that worked very well. Yuzhen learned a lot about the backend structure this past week and also learned a lot about databases and SQL. As for where she had trouble, Yuzhen had a little bit of trouble with the login logic which is why the methods for that are tentative. She is no longer stuck on this though as discussing with Carrie has helped the two of them reach a conclusion on what would be best for the project.
