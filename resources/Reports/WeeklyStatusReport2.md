### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

As a team, we spent the past week moving forward with the testing and coding components of our project. This week, we completed more of the front-end components of our website through the use of HTML and CSS. As of this week, Hai switched over to join Carrie and Yuzhen in the backend team meaning that Drishya is doing the entire front-end work. Drishya has finished the basic HTML and CSS for the webpage and is about to start working on the JavaScript. This week the backend team worked on the Testing & CI/CD assignment that was due this past Tuesday. The backend team implemented the controllers and test suites for them as well. Both the frontend and backend teams felt like most of what they did worked. The backend team did have some issues with some warnings that occurred while adding the test suites and were stuck on this for a little while but ended up figuring it out so that it was still built successfully. They learnt a lot about how to integrate testing into our project. The frontend team had some issues with positioning the various elements on the web page and were stuck on this for a while but eventually solved it after switching from using the display flex property to using the already existing box model properties. The front-end team learned a lot about websites and stylistic design choices this past week.

### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

Drishya: This past week, Drishya implemented the HTML and CSS for the cumulative.do website. She researched about styling and design and implemented the basic features necessary for users to be able to interact with the application. She felt that what worked was the HTML and CSS. The website looks similar to the UX/UI designs that Hai created in the previous weeks. She learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and front-end design this week. Drishya had some trouble with positioning various elements on the webpage because she initially tried to use the display flex property she learned about in her web programming class. This caused some unintended display issues and she was stuck for a while. She solved this by switching over to the simple box model instead which ended up working just fine.

Hai: This past week, Hai contributed to the design and architecture of the project. Hai also researched coding guidelines, documentation, and testing and ended up learning a lot about these topics which worked well. He helped Drishya with a bit of front-end stuff before transitioning to work on the backend with Carrie and Yuzhen. Hai also worked on the testing and CI/CD assignment due this past week. He ran into some issues with this regarding the warning errors but the build ended up being successful so he wasn’t stuck on any of this. 

Yuzhen: This past week, Yuzhen worked with Carrie on the next backend components. They did some research, finalized the design and architecture, implemented the controllers and test suites for them, and wrote documentation for this. The design and architecture components worked well as the team now has a solid foundation from which they can build off for their project. Yuzehn learned a lot about testing this week through the work she did for the checkpoint. She had some trouble with the warning errors but the build ended up being successful so she wasn’t stuck on any of this. 

Carrie: This past week, Carrie worked with Yuzhen on the next backend components. They did some research, finalized the design and architecture, implemented the controllers and test suites for them, and wrote documentation for this. The design and architecture components worked well as the team now has a solid foundation from which they can build off for their project.
