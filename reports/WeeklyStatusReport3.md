### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

As a team, we spent the past week preparing for this week’s alpha release. Both the frontend and backend teams worked on coding their respective parts of the project and then came together at the end of the week to try to connect the two and to also complete the requirements for the alpha release. Specifically, as part of the frontend team, Drishya finished implementing the entire main HTML page and the main login page and added JavaScript functionality so that a user can actually interact with the application. Along with this, Drishya added styling through CSS to make the user interface more aesthetically pleasing for users. What worked well with the front end is getting the user interface up and running. We now have a fully functional basic application! While working on the front end, the front end team had trouble with the flex box styling because the navigation bar wasn’t aligning properly and also with the finished class being applied to the finished task. However, Drishya fixed this through debugging in the console and learned a lot about how the flex model in CSS works and how JavaScript and the DOM work. After the past week, the front-end team is not really stuck anywhere. In the past week, the backend team implemented the test suite to ensure that completed parts are working properly, implemented a controller class to store data through the use of data structures, began implementing the web scraper, and started working on server development. What worked well for the backend team was implementing the test suite and the controller class. However, as the backend team began implementing the backend they ran into some issues and had trouble working with git. Many merge conflicts occurred and the backend team had to figure out how to fix these issues. This allowed the backend team to learn a lot about git and dealing with merge conflicts. As for where the backend team is stuck, they are a little stuck on implementing the web scraper. The issue they are facing here is that there are many different types of websites to scrape so the web scraper has to know how to pull data from each of these different types of sites.

### Plans & Goals For Upcoming Week:

    * Time Estimate: 1 Day

### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

Drishya: This past week, Drishya implemented the main and login pages through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the cumulative.do website. Drishya also updated the README.md document for the alpha release and participated in the presentation by demoing the application. She felt that what worked well was both the look of the site, as it seems very clean and user-friendly, and the JavaScript, which allows the front end to have functionality such as logging in and actually inputting tasks. Drishya learned a lot about the DOM, JavaScript, and Flexbox styling through CSS. She had a little bit of trouble with the flex box styling because the navigation bar wasn’t aligning properly and also with the finished class being applied to the finished task. However, Drishya fixed this through debugging in the console. Drishya doesn’t feel stuck anywhere really but the next step with connecting the frontend and backend seems a little confusing to her.

Hai: This past week, Hai worked with Yuzhen and Carrie and contributed to implementing the test suite, implementing the controller class to store data through the use of data structures, and implementing the web scraper and server development. Hai also helped to create the slides for the Alpha release presentation. What worked well for Hai was implementing the test suite and the controller class and creating the slides for the presentation. Hai learned a lot about git and dealing with merge conflicts through the trouble the backend team faced when working with git (many merge conflicts occurred and Hai had to help figure out how to fix these issues). Hai is currently a little stuck on implementing the web scraper because there are many different types of websites to scrape so the web scraper has to know how to pull data from each of these different types of sites.

Yuzhen: This past week, Yuzhen worked with Hai and Carrie and contributed to implementing the test suite, implementing the controller class to store data through the use of data structures, and implementing the web scraper and server development. Yuzhen also helped to demo the code base for the Alpha release presentation. What worked well for Yuzhen was implementing the test suite and the controller class. Yuzhen learned a lot about git and dealing with merge conflicts through the trouble the backend team faced when working with git (many merge conflicts occurred and Yuzhen had to help figure out how to fix these issues). Yuzhen is currently a little stuck on implementing the web scraper because there are many different types of websites to scrape so the web scraper has to know how to pull data from each of these different types of sites.


Carrie: This past week, Carrie worked with Hai and Yuzhen and contributed to implementing the test suite, implementing the controller class to store data through the use of data structures, and implementing the web scraper and server development. Carrie also helped to create the slides for the Alpha release presentation. What worked well for Carrie was implementing the test suite, the controller class, and creating the slides. Carrie learned a lot about git and dealing with merge conflicts through the trouble the backend team faced when working with git (many merge conflicts occurred and Carrie had to help figure out how to fix these issues). Carrie is currently a little stuck on implementing the web scraper because there are many different types of websites to scrape so the web scraper has to know how to pull data from each of these different types of sites.
