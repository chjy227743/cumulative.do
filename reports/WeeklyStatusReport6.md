### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

As a team, we spent the past week progressing toward our final release. The front-end team made a lot of progress by fixing the finish task to-do list functionality and finishing the course selection page. What worked well was both of these things. The new button replacement for the checkbox means that the task can successfully be removed from the to-do list. The frontend team learned a lot about event handlers and the DOM tree this week as working with all the buttons involved understanding event handlers and working with parent and child objects. The frontend team had a little trouble with the checkbox bug initially and was stuck but they are no longer stuck because they switched this to a button instead which solved the bug. The backend team made progress by building 3 more web scrapers for CSE 332, CSE 312, and CSE 421. These web scrapers worked well as they passed all the tests. The backend team learned a lot about debugging this week as they continued to progress on the web scrapers. The backend team had a little trouble with returning JSON objects and was stuck but they talked to the front-end team and thus are no longer stuck on this. 

### Plans & Goals For Upcoming Week:
