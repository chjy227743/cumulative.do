### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

As a team, we spent the past week preparing for this week’s beta release. Both the frontend and backend teams worked on coding their respective parts of the project and then came together at the end of the week to try to connect the two parts. Specifically, this week the front-end team worked on changing up the website styling to make it more user-friendly. What worked well for the front-end team was getting the to-do list content to be separated out into multiple columns and to pass information back to the backend. The frontend team learned a lot about the flex model and box model for CSS as it took a while to get the columns aligned properly. Unfortunately, the front-end team had a lot of trouble with adding an event handler to the new checkbox feature they added to the website. The front-end team spent a lot of time trying to fix this but is unfortunately still stuck on it. As for the backend team, this week they finished one web scraper, set up the server, switched from maven to gradle, and helped the front end with connecting front end and backend. What worked well for the backend team was setting up the server because this allowed them to finally be able to work on connecting the front end and backend. During the past week, they happened to learn a lot about web scrapers and now feel much more confident in being able to create more. The backend team did have a little trouble with the server initially and was stuck. The front-end and back-end connection was not working. However, they are no longer stuck on this because they spent hours debugging this and was able to fix it.

### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

Drishya: This past week, Drishya worked on changing up the website styling to make it more user-friendly and wrote up the entire weekly status report 4. What worked well for her was getting the to-do list content to be separated out into multiple columns and passing information back to the backend.

Unfortunately, she had a lot of trouble with adding an event handler to the new checkbox feature that she added to the website this past week. Drishya spent a lot of time trying to fix this but is unfortunately still stuck on it. 

Hai: This past week, Hai implemented methods for the web scraper, created some tests for them, wrote some of the beta release documentation, revised some of the revisions our project manager gave, did canvas and web scraper research, and worked on fixing some git issues. What worked well for Hai was writing up some of the beta release documentation. Through his research this past week, Hai learned a lot about web scrapers, servers, and the Canvas API. Hai had a little trouble with the beta release documentation and was stuck because at first he was confused by some of the terminology. However, Hai is no longer stuck on this because he was able to clear up his confusion and finish the documentation.
