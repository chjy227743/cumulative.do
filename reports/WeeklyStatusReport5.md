### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

As a team, we spent the past week progressing towards our final release which is next week. The front-end team made some progress with coding the profile page and the select classes page but has not finished this yet. What worked well for the front-end team was the select classes page. The ability to select a class and save what class the user has selected seems to be functioning as expected as of right now. The front-end team learned a lot about the DOM this week as having to select classes deals a lot with DOM manipulation. Unfortunately, the front-end team still had trouble with fixing the checkbox event handler bug. The front-end team is stuck on this because nothing has worked to fix this after two weeks of trying to solve it. As for the backend team, this week they continued to work on implementing more web scrapers, fixed some bugs from last week, and attempted to establish the database. What worked well for the backend team was fixing the bugs from last week as those no longer exist as of this week. From doing all of this, the backend team learned a lot about debugging and testing code. Unfortunately, the backend team had some trouble with implementing the database. They are stuck on this but they think they might be able to figure it out by the final release.

### Progress & Issues In The Past Week:

Drishya: This past week, Drishya worked on coding the profile page and the select classes page but has not finished this yet. What worked well for her was coding the select classes page. The ability to select a class and save what class the user has selected seems to be functioning as expected as of right now. This past week, Drishya learned a lot about the DOM as having to select classes deals a lot with DOM manipulation. Unfortunately, she still had trouble with fixing the checkbox event handler bug. Drishya is stuck on this because nothing has worked to fix this after two weeks of trying to solve it. At this point, Drishya thinks maybe she should change the checkbox to something else, or go to the office hours for her web programming class to seek help.

Hai: This past week, Hai worked with Yuzhen and Carrie and continued to work on implementing more web scrapers. Hai also fixed some bugs from last week, and attempted to establish the database. What worked well for Hai was fixing the bugs from last week as those no longer exist as of this week. From doing all of this, Hai has learned a lot about debugging and testing code. Unfortunately, Hai and the rest of the backend team had some trouble with implementing the database. He is stuck on this but thinks that he might be able to figure it out by the final release.
